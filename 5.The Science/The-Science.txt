#Focus vs Diffuse Mode
    - two states of brain
    - focus mode - all your energy is focussed on one thing
    - diffuse mode - thinking about different things, brain wanders
    - how well you learn depends on going back and forth between focus & diffuse mode
    - intense focus forms a sheet over the brain cells - Myelin sheath
    - studying little bit everyday is better than cramming at once
    - you can be in only one mode at a time

#The science of sleep
    - lack of sleep is not good for long term learning
    - sleep clears toxins out of the brain
    - cerebral spinal fluid increases during sleep
    - sleep is also a diffuse mode

#Brain Training
    - strengthen the connection between neurons to keep in memory for long term
    - brain is like a muscle
    - practice makes stronger connections
    - use it or lose it

#The science of feedback
    - negative feedback vs positive feedback
    - feedback is an integral part of learning
    - criticism is usually more actionable, effective for learning
    - feedback is important for achieving mastery

#Procrastination
    - something we feel like not doing right now
    - we procrastinate because we feeel better when we postpone
    - start doing the task no matter what
    - short term positivity vs long term positivity

#Short and Long term memory
    - long term - stored in different regions of our brain; practise over and over; fundamentals
    - short term - working memory; pre-frontal cortex; 4 chunks of information in short term memory
    - over repeated use short term becomes long term memory
    - spaced retition technique
    - 20 things over 20 days is better than 20 things 20 times in one day

#Active vs Passive learning
    - learn more by active engagement
    - watching things is passive learning 
    - taking notes, practice & solving problems is active learning
    - active learning > passive learning
    - practice & recalling is the better way of learning
    - test is better than re-reading the lessons

#The Science of motivation
    - intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation
    - intrinsic drive is needed for continuous learning
        autonomy - control over lives
        mastery - to be good at something
        purpose - destiny and how this affects yourself & others
    - over justification effect => external factor reduces intrinsic motivation
    - small rewards help in doing things initially
    - for long term intrinsic motivation is really needed

#Goals
    - roadmap; big goals & small goals
    - KAIZEN - continuous small incremental improvements
    - small steps eliminate the fear of failure
    - small little steps each day compound over long term
    - hit small targets continuously
    - Specific; Measurable; Achievable; Relevant; Time bound => SMART goals

#It pays to not be busy
    - being busy is not a good thing; signifies lack of time management
    - breaks are good for productivity
    - more does not always mean better

#Chunking
    - focus creates chunks of knowledge
    - break down a complex problem into small chunks that are simple and relatable
    - bottom up learning
    - break down to small chunks - combine them - relate them to create a mind map and form the larger picture
    - top down learning

#How to solve problems
    - focus mode vs diffuse mode
    - ideas & intuition
    - we should use diffuse mode to solve problems also
    - go back and forth

#Delibrate practice
    - learning process should be tough
    - frustrations are good 
    - visualize your moves ahead of time
    - practice gives you the ability to visualize future steps
    - delibrate practice helps to break plateau
        Specific Goals
        Intense focus
        Immediate feedback
        frequent discomfort 
    - try things that are outside your comfort zone
    - practice maximizes our potential
