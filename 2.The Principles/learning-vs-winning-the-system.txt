#Don't focus on passing the test or getting praise fomr your manager; instead foacus on learning the subject at hand

# focus on long term learning

#what is success? smart vs successful; drive & persistence leads to success

#Those who have drive and persistence are successful

#The obstacle:
    - when we learn something we often feel like we suck at it.
    - frustration
    - change your mind to think like good we are doing something
    - all successful people were beginners once
    - embrace the obstacles, the hard lessons that failures teach
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Obstacle_Is_the_Way

#The Dip
    - while learning we will face periods of low points
    - not everyone can achieve what they want
    - sometimes we are not cut out for it
    - we must know when to quit
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dip

#Compound Learning
    - learning should occur everyday
    - make small changes everyday
    - break big tasks into small ones which we can do everyday
    - Improve by 1% a day and in 70 days you are twice as good - Alan Weiss
    - Spend 20 minutes each day on focussed learning

#Failures don't count
    - people only know your current state
    - so your past failures doesn't matter
    - be successful just 1% of the time
    - every time we fail we learn something

#Choice vs chore
    - it should be choice and not a chore
    - do something you enjoy
    - in long time the choice beats out the chore

#It's all in the frame
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framing_effect_(psychology)
    - frames - humans use to change perspective
    - instead of feeling low about learning consider it as you are overcoming an obstacle
    - don't complain and postpone
    - think like you are not there yet but you will be there eventually
    - shift your focus to what you can control instead of focussing on what can go wrong

#Pareto Principle
    - 80/20 rule =>  80% of the results come from 20% of the inputs
    - eliminating the 100% to 20%
    - what is the 20% that is going to give 100% of the result
    - mastery => being in the top 5%
    - Always check if this 20% is the best use of your time and invest in it
    - Adding things to your queue doesn't mean its better; focus on the 20%

#Skill Stacking
    - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_(book)
    - Three important factors
            Curiosity
            Value Learning 
            Gathering and combining skills in a unique way 
    - Instead of getting good at one thing: combine things and master it
    - you will not be the best in any one partcular skill
    - but if you skill stack you can be in the top 20% which is more valuable
    - pick skils that work well together but still are varied enough

#Happiness factors
    - find all your key Happiness factors
    - be in a positive happy state
    - write 5-7 key things that make you happy and monitor them

#Your Productivity time
    - find your productive time
    - fix your learning time based on that

#Self Learning Paradigm
    - your job to decide on the path of self learner
    - motivation should come from within
